# Backend Go Tutorial

Welcome to this project! This git repository is here to accompany students on the course "Build an e-commerce website with Go, Vue.js and AWS" available on [practical-go-lessons.com](https://www.practical-go-lessons.com/). 

The code on this `main` branch is not complete. When you follow the course sessions, I often ask you to switch from one branch to another. You will be able to see the project grows but also to exercise!

The course has **many applications** that allow you to build features **by yourself**, then see a complete **live correction** of the applications.

During this course, you will build two other projects :
- A back office for employees in VueJs: https://github.com/maximilienandile/bo-go-tuto
- A frontend for clients in VueJs: https://github.com/maximilienandile/frontend-go-tuto
